# Documentation

The `Doxyfile` in this directory may be used with Doxygen to generate the documentation for this project. The files will be output to a `ManiaMap.Docs` folder next to the main project folder.

For online hosting, a separate repository has been created for the output files: https://github.com/mpewsey/ManiaMap.Docs/. It will generally be updated for each tagged version release.

The online documentation is available at: https://mpewsey.github.io/ManiaMap.Docs/.
